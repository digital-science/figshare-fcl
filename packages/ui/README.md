## About
`fcl` is an open source library for some of the React UI components used across the web interface of the Figshare research repository.

## Usage

### Installation

The package is provided through the GitHub packages registry; in order to be able to install it you will need to add the registry for the `@figshare` scope to your `.npmrc` file, for example:

```
@figshare:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/
```

You can now install the components package to your project's `node_modules`:
```
npm install --save @figshare/fcl
```

The sources are provided as is, and the components need to be passed through your projects `build/transpilation pipeline` as a transpiled distribution is not provided.

If you're using Webpack, you can configure your Babel loader rules to `include node_modules/@figshare` in the transpilation process. Our components are provided as class components with `es6` class features such as `statics` and `class properties`, so you may need to allow these features in your `babelrc` file. See `@babel/proposal-class-properties`.

Stylesheets are imported using `css-modules` so you might have to configure your pipeline to support them. The library exposes rules and variables through the `index.css` file available in `@figshare/fcl/styles/`. Import it in your project entry point:

```
import "@figshare/fcl/styles/index.css"
```

We recommend setting a custom `css-module` name generation rule for class names defined for files inside `node_modules/@figshare/fcl` to `fcl-[name]-[local]`:

```js
// webpack loader example:
{
    test: "**/@figshare/fcl/**.css"
    use: [{
    loader: "css-loader",
    options: {
        importLoaders: 1,
        modules: {
            localIdentName: "fcl-[name]-[local]" 
        },
        sourceMap: true,
    },
    }]
```

This will allow you to easily reference and target FCL component `classnames` in your stylesheets and add custom style and layout rules as required, without having to provide `className` to exported components.


### Importing and using components
To use components simply import them from the package. You can find examples in the stories folder or on the documentation site (see below).

```jsx
import { Button, IconButton } "@figshare/fcl/button"
import Calendar "@figshare/fcl/icons/calendar";

// render
<Button onClick={...}>A Button</Button>
<IconButton icon={Calendar} onClick={...}>An Icon Button</IconButton>
```
